## Self-hosting

Self hosting this chatbot is pretty easy. You just need to follow this steps:

1. Get your OPENAI Token from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - You will need to set a payment method.

2. Generate a new bot:
   1. Start a new chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot.
   2. Type `/newbot` command. Set a name and a username.
   3. Copy the Token that BotFather will give you.
   
3. Get allowed users' IDs:
   1. Start a new chat with [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot).
   2. Send a message or forward a message from any desired user.
   3. Copy the `message.from.id` field value. Should be an ID like: 1234567890

4. Setup the bot:
   1. Clone this repo.
   2. Rename the `example.env` file to `.env`.
   3. Edit the environment variables from the `.env` file:
      - Set your OPENAI_TOKEN.
      - Set your BOT_TOKEN.
      - Set your ALLOWED_USERS (comma separated user ids). Set it to `*` to allow all users.
      - Set the SYSTEM_PROMPT for ChatGPT. This is always instructed to ChatGPT as the system.
      - Optional: Edit the MAX_CONTEXT. This variable sets the number of messages that will be sent to ChatGPT API as context for the conversation.
      - WHISPER_TO_CHAT allows you to choose wether Whisper transcripts should be instructed to ChatGPT or not.
         - You can also configure this using `/settings` in chat.
